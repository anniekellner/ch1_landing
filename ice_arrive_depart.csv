pb_06817,2006,9/21/2006,16:01:00,9/22/2006,0:01:00,"Very late season ice. This bear remains on ice until the bonepile appears. Bear starts moving eastward on 9/13, same day as the first harvest on Cross Island. "
pb_20333,2008,8/16/2008,20:00:37,8/30/2006,12:00:37,"Undecided bear. Goes back out to sparse, undetectable ice.  Chunk is visible 08/16 near where bear appears to 'swim' back out into the ocean. "
pb_20413,2006,9/14/2006,16:00:00,9/20/2006,0:01:00,Bear lands in August but goes straight back out to ice until September. Listed as 'undecided'? Appears to be motivated by the bonepile. See email with TA and DD
pb_20414,2009,7/18/2009,9:00:00,7/23/2009,4:00:00,Last point bear is on ice. Appears to swim north before turning south and swimming basically straight to land (straight south)
pb_20418,2005,8/19/2005,16:00:00,9/7/2005,16:00:00,Southward movement begins much earlier ~7/31. See notes for undecided bears. 
pb_20446,2009,7/28/2009,7:00:00,7/31/2009,11:00:00,"Last point ice detected. Bear swims west, does a curly-q (looking for ice?), then swims nearly directly south "
pb_20520,2012,8/15/2012,4:00:00,8/16/2012,2:00:00,No ice detected but presumably bear is on very sparse ice based on movement patterns. Confirmed on MODIS that chunks of ice exist that are not detected by MASIE. 8/13 is a clear day close to 8/15 and we can see the chunks.
pb_20525,2013,8/17/2013,0:00:13,8/18/2013,20:01:00,"Departure point 3.6 km from edge of pack ice, presumably bear is on thin ice. Points disappear after this suggesting bear is swimming. "
pb_20525,2014,8/14/2014,16:00:29,8/13/2014,0:00:49,Bear does not appear to swim. Likely walks along the edge of the pack ice (on undetectable ice) until goes ashore. Goes back out to ice for a day before settling on land. 
pb_20529,2005,9/20/2005,16:00:00,9/20/2005,18:01:00,
pb_20544,2004,10/31/2004,20:00:00,11/1/2004,16:00:00,Spends summer on ice - only comes to shore after ice reforms over shelf (?)
pb_20735,2009,7/25/2009,6:00:00,7/27/2009,3:00:00,Sparse ice visible in area 7/17 on MASIE. Visualization on MODIS indicates sparse ice (separated from pack ice) is still in area until 7/24. Southward turn (swim) on 7/25 seems to correspond with melt in that region. 
pb_20845,2015,8/27/2015,19:00:19,8/27/2015,22:01:33,Looks like bear uses ice until the last minute. 
pb_21015,2013,8/16/2013,18:00:16,8/18/2013,4:00:54,Very sparse ice visible in MODIS
pb_21264,2011,7/28/2011,20:00:00,8/2/2011,16:00:00,Takes off not too far from edge of detectable pack ice - signal lost until arrival on land
pb_21358,2013,8/14/2013,8:00:00,8/17/2013,20:00:00,Double-check departure with what was previosly called. Subjective because signal is not lost; clear directional movement that ends on land; appears to begin at this point
pb_21368,2014,8/11/2014,4:00:09,8/11/2014,22:00:29,Cannot see ice in MODIS; see 20525. Follows very similar (parallel) path but slightly south. 
pb_32366,2011,8/6/2011,4:00:00,8/10/2011,4:00:00,Extremely tiny chunks of ice visible in MODIS. 
pb_32366,2014,8/12/2014,22:00:11,8/13/2014,14:00:22,Similar path to others in 2014. Hmm. Signal is lost and then bear appears on land.
